2000-12-15  Michael Pruett <mpruett@sgi.com>

	* Released version 0.2.

2000-11-01  Michael Pruett <mpruett@sgi.com>

	* libaudiofile/*: Finished integrating the modules code.

2000-10-26  Michael Pruett <mpruett@sgi.com>

	* libaudiofile/raw.c: Added support for raw file reading and
	writing.

2000-10-24  Michael Pruett <mpruett@sgi.com>

	* libaudiofile/*: Cleaned up the Audio File Library and improved
	error handling.

2000-10-09  Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

	* libaudiofile/wave*.[ch]: WAVE format chunks can occur in any
	order.  Processing of WAVE chunks now acts accordingly.
	(Thanks to Michael Krause for pointing out shortcomings in the
	previous implementation.)
	* libaudiofile/*.[ch]: The VFS layer doesn't handle SEEK_END
	as a valid mode for fseek; we must use af_flength instead.
	* Removed query from the test suite as it did not handle
	values of AU_NULL_PVLIST returned from afQuery.  (It even
	crashes under IRIX.)

2000-10-04  Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

	* libaudiofile/*.c: Added better error handling.
	* libaudiofile/*.c: Added the file format unit structure,
	updated querying accordingly.  All queries except compression
	types are implemented.
	* Added query and query2 to the test suite.

2000-09-13  Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

	* libaudiofile/*.c: Added support for G.711 a-law, thanks to
	Bruce Forsberg.

1999-11-20  Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

	* libaudiofile/*.c: Cleaning up, added afOpenFD.

1999-08-21  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* */*c: Even more warning fixes - initialize vars, add 'int' as return
	type of a function, and include headers.
	
1999-08-20 Elliot Lee <sopwith@redhat.com>
	* */*.c: More warning fixes - remove unused variables, add 'int' as return type
	of main(), and include some more header files.

1999-08-18 Anders Carlsson  <anders.carlsson@tordata.se>

	* Fixed compiler warnings.

1999-08-16 Elliot Lee <sopwith@redhat.com>
	* libaudiofile/af_vfs.[ch]: Virtualize file access.
	* libaudiofile/*.[ch]: Use the new virtualized file access routines.

1999-05-09  Michael Pruett  <michael@68k.org>

	* bread.c, ulaw.c: If more sample frames are requested than
	remain in the file, limit the number of sample frames that can
	be returned.  This bug was brought to my attention by Scott
	Heavner.
	* test/sgi.[ch]: These files contain SGI Audio Library routines
	used in SGI-specific test programs.
	* test/irixread.c, test/irixtest.c, test/irixtestloop.c: These
	programs now use the routines contained in sgi.[ch] and are more
	robust.

1999-05-23  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* test/miscread.c: Include <config.h>.
	* test/miscwrite.c: Likewise.
	* test/writeaiff.c: Likewise.

	* test/writeulaw.c: Likewise.
	* test/writewave.c: Likewise.
 	  
1999-05-09  Michael Pruett  <michael@68k.org>

	* Merge in Audio File Library version 0.1.7.

	* aiff.c: Fixed an obscure bug in AIFF parsing in the
	instrument chunk parsing code.  Made AIFF parsing slightly
	cleaner by replacing multiple-character constant comparisons
	with memcmp and strings.

	* compression.[ch]: Added support for compressed audio.

	* au.c, auwrite.c, ulaw.c, g711.[ch]: Incorporated support for
	G.711 mu-law encoding.  Currently this encoding is only available
	for NeXT/Sun .snd/.au format files.

	* audiofile.c: Virtual byte order is now set properly.

	* aiff.c, audiofile.c, auwrite.c, bread.c, bwrite.c,
	compression.c, instrument.c, loop.c, marker.c, misc.c,
	query.c, ulaw.c: Added more error checking.

	* docs/*: Documentation has been improved.

	* test/*: Several simple test programs have been added as a
	test suite.

	* sfcommands/*: Fix hard-coded virtual byte order since it's
	now set by the library.

	* configure.in: Fixed platform-specific tests and detect byte
	order at configuration time.

1999-04-11  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* audiofile.spec.in: added %{prefix}/share/aclocal/* to files
	list for the devel package.

1999-02-24  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* configure.in (BUILD_STATIC_LIBS): New automake conditional.

	* sfcommands/Makefile.am, test/Makefile.am: Only link statically
	if we build static libraries.

1999-02-22  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* libaudiofile/audiofile.h (extern "C"): Remove duplicated
	__cplusplus guards.

1999-02-22  Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* Fixed spec file to be autogenerated

1999-02-22  Michael Pruett  <michael@68k.org>
	    Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* */*: Merge in audiofile 0.1.6.
	
1999-01-20  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* libaudiofile/wave.c:
	Fix newly-uncovered bug caught by Mike Bond <mike.bond@template.com>.

1999-01-17  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* aiff.c, wave.c:
	Replaced some [int == '1234'] comparisons with memcmp.

	* aiff.h:
	Replaced large enum value with 'const unsigned long' instead, to
	silence ANSI C compiler warning.

	* ulaw.c:
	Converted function declarations from K&R to ANSI C, silencing a
	(big surprise) ANSI C compiler warning.

	* libaudiofile/Makefile.am:
	Remove non-existent instrument.h, loop.h, marker.h

	* sfcommands/Makefile.am:
	Add README to EXTRA_DIST.

	* libaudiofile/aiff.c, libaudiofile/aiffwrite.c,
	  libaudiofile/audiofile.c, libaudiofile/auwrite.c,
	  libaudiofile/bread.c, libaudiofile/bwrite.c,

	  libaudiofile/swapblock.c, libaudiofile/swapblock.h,
	  libaudiofile/ulaw.c, libaudiofile/ulaw.h:
	More namespace cleanups.  Made a few functions static, several
	more renamed to add "_af_" prefix.

	* libaudiofile/instrument.h, libaudiofile/loop.h,
	  libaudiofile/marker.h:
	Removed because they only contained prototypes of static funcs,
	and were included only by their implementation modules.

1999-01-16  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* test/transparency.c:
	Change to unsigned short to avoid Sun CC warning.

	* libaudiofile/swapblock.c:
	Changed const long to a #define, Sun CC choked on the const.
	The definition of u_int16_t may be interfering with array
	definitions like this one, b/c u_int16_t is a macro instead of a
	typedef on Solaris platforms.

	* acconfig.h:
	Protected against multiple inclusion, using @TOP@ and @BOTTOM@.

	* libaudiofile/afinternal.h:
	Include config.h for u_int8_t and friends.

	* libaudiofile/audiofile.h, libaudiofile/aupvlist.h:
	Mark as extern 'c' if C++ compile.

	* libaudiofile/aiff.c, libaudiofile/aiffwrite.c,
	  libaudiofile/au.c, libaudiofile/audiofile.c,
	  libaudiofile/auwrite.c, libaudiofile/bread.c,

	Renamed a some exported private functions to _af_funcname
	to prevent collision.

1999-01-16  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* autogen.sh configure.in acconfig.h:
	Added AM_CONFIG_HEADER and requisite support for it.

	Conditionally include config.h.

1999-01-16  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* libaudiofile/error.c (afSetErrorHandler): Provide a better
	implementation which agrees with the semantics of the variable
	names, and usual "set_error_handler" type of functions.  (Modifies
	a "fix" in commit: "1999-01-16  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>").

1999-01-16  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* libaudiofile/aes.c, libaudiofile/aiff.c, libaudiofile/aiffwrite.c,
	  libaudiofile/au.c, libaudiofile/audiofile.c, libaudiofile/aupv.c,
	  libaudiofile/auwrite.c, libaudiofile/bread.c, libaudiofile/bwrite.c,

	Corrected missing-default-case, unused-var, no-return-value,
	implicit-declaration, other gcc warnings.  Fixing those warnings
	also fixed many bugs.

	* test/adddcoffset.c, test/copy.c, test/linuxtest.c, test/miscread.c,
	  test/miscwrite.c, test/results.c, test/transparency.c:
	Changed main() declaration to standard one, fixed warnings.

1999-01-01  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* libaudiofile/audiofile.h:
	Corrected comma-in-final-element warnings.

1998-12-10  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* tests/miscwrite.c:
	include string.h to silence warning about strlen

Tue Dec  8 21:38:08 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* auto* fixes for make dist

1998-12-07  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* LICENSE:
	Removed.  Automake automatically adds the file COPYING to the
	distribution, so this file is redundant.

1998-12-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* libaudiofile/Makefile.am, au.c, audiofile.c, audiofile.h,
	bread.c, teach libaudiofile how to handle u-law encoded .au
	files. NOTE: only added routines for reading files.

	* libaudiofile/ulaw.c, libaudiofile/ulaw.h: u-law algorithms from 
	http://www.itl.atr.co.jp/comp.speech/Section2/Q2.7.html.

1998-10-21 Bertrand Guiheneuf <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@inria.fr>
	* added an audiofile-config and an audiofile.m4
	
1998-10-17  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (u_int_{8,16,32}_t): Define these to some "natural"
	C types if the typedefs are missing.

	* libaudiofile/Makefile.am (include_HEADERS): 
	Remove spurious empty line.

Wed Oct  7 02:13:34 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* auto* stuff fixes

Wed Oct  7 02:08:30 CDT 1998   Frank Belew   <frb@umr.edu>
	
	* added support for automake, and libtool

1998-07-16  Michael Pruett  <michael@68k.org>

	* Changes for the Audio File Library version 0.1.4.

	AES data functions are now implemented.  They're only effective
	whenusing the AIFF/AIFF-C formats.

	Miscellaneous data functions are now implemented for the
	AIFF/AIFF-C file formats.

	The Audio File Library now uses GNU autoconf.

	The Audio File Library now builds shared libraries.

	Some rudimentary documentation is now included.

1998-06-22  Michael Pruett  <michael@68k.org>

	* Changes for the Audio File Library version 0.1.3

	The Linux-specific test programs should work on all Linux
	platforms which support audio.  (I believe this includes just
	Linux/i386, Linux/PowerPC, and Linux/Alpha.  I may be wrong.)

	The function afReadFrames now returns the proper value.

	The afGetInstParams, afSetInstParams, afGetInstParamLong, and
	afSetInstParamLong calls are now implemented to the same extent
	that SGI's versions are.

	Instrument, marker, and loop data functions are now fully
	implemented.  I'll eventually get around to the miscellaneous data
	functions.

	The AUpvlist functions have been implemented and tested.  The
	afQuery calls are on my list of things to implement.

	A few minor bugs have been fixed.
