This is a sample command line example of how to ue the OSALP library. It
will perform many functions as outlined below. 

COMPILE:
make

USAGE:
Users should call the program using the start_osalp script.

INSTRUCTIONS:
This program will parse arguments passed into it in order to process
an audio file. There are many kinds of arguments accepted. The first
class of arguments will select what mode to put the program in. Some
of the mode arguments require an argument as well.
  MODES
 
<Audio file to be played>               === Play mode to audio device
-p <Audio file to pitch shift>          === Record mode from audio device
-m <Audio file to mix with play file>   === Play mix mode
-i <Audio file to ID>                   === ID audio file
-h                                      === Print help message
-a                                      === Print supported audio formats

The next class of arguments are modifier arguments. They will modify the
behavior of the modes above. They only apply to certain modes above.
  FILE FORMAT MODIFIERS
-s <Sample rate as ASCII string>	=== set sample rate
-f <Format to use from -a mode>		=== set format
-b 					=== signed byte data
-B 					=== unsigned byte data
-w 					=== signed word data
-W 					=== unsigned word data
-c <channels>				=== set channels

  Convert/Play/Record Mode
  ---------
start_osalp [format options] input_file [format options] [output_file] 

The above will play an audio file input_file to the default audio device if no 
output_file is given. If no format_options are given for the input_file then
the file will be auto-detected.  If you want to write the file to a different 
device or file give a output_file and optional output options.

  Pitch Mode
  ---------
start_osalp -p <pitch rate> [format options] input_file [format options] [output_file] 

The above will play an audio file input_file to the default audio device if no 
output_file is given. If no format_options are given for the input_file then
the file will be auto-detected.  If you want to write the file to a different 
device or file give a output_file and optional output options.

  Mix Mode
  --------
start_osalp -m [format options] input_file1 [format options] input_file2 
		[format options] [output_file] 

The above will mix two audio files together equally and play them to an audio
device. The audio files can be any supported OSALP audio formats and don't
have to be the same.

  ID Mode
  -------
start_osalp -i audio.wav

The above will print out information regarding the audio file.

  Help Mode
  ---------  
start_osalp -h

The above will print out a help message indicating the options available.

  Audio Format Mode
  -----------------
start_osalp -a

The above will print out the audio formats supported for this application. It
will print one per line. These can be used for the -f modifier.
