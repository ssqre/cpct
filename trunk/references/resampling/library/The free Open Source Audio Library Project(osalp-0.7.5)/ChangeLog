02/22/2008     V 0.7.5 Beta released.

-------------------------------------------------------
02/22/2008 Darrick Servis <darrick@dcn.org> 	

  o added doc/html/api to distribution.

------------------------------------------------------

07/03/2002     V 0.7.3 Beta released.

-------------------------------------------------------
07/01/02 Darrick Servis <darrick@dcn.org> 	

	o aflib/aflibConvertor.cc - Minor changes to SrcUP and SrcUD to fix
	  compilation errors with Visual C++.  Thanks to 
	  "Armin Gerritsen" <armin.gerritsen@hetnet.nl> for pointing this
	  out and Julius Smith <jos@w3k.org> for providing the fix.

	o examples/osalp - Added configure script and getopt_long coding.  
	  Now compiles for FreeBSD and Solaris.

	o aflib/aflibDateTime.cc - Changed localtime_r to localtime.  Now
	  compiles for Darwin.  This was the only Posix extension used in
          code.

-------------------------------------------------------
05/10/02 Darrick Servis <darrick@dcn.org> 	

	o In aflibAudioSampleRateCvt.  Fixed memory leek in compute_segment.

	o configure. Added tests for blade, lame and mpg123 executibles. 
	  Repaired module install location.  Added option for path
	  to sox source code.  Upgraded to autoconf-2.5.3, automake-1.6.1
	  and libtool-1.4.2.  
	
	o cleaned up the osalp example.  added testsox.sh script.  
	  added pitch mode.

	o handled errors for file opening in player and editor examples.


-------------------------------------------------------
03/10/02 Darrick Servis <darrick@dcn.org> 	

	o In aflibAudioMixer.  compute_segment now clips the final mix to the
	  limits of it's data size.  This fixes the amplitude problem where
 	  having more then one mix with amplitude 100 would cause distortion.
	  Result is a default amplitude of 100 is sufficient for most mixes.

	o In aflibAudioStereoToMono. Added setAmplitude function.  Renamed 
	  setMix function to setMixType.  Added support for replacing
	  parent (addParent will replace existing parent).

	o In aflibAiffFile, aflibAifcFile, aflibAuFile and aflibWavFile.  
	  Fixed bug in afread where position was over running the length 
	  of the file.

	o Added ogg to configure script.

-------------------------------------------------------
02/15/02 Darrick Servis <darrick@dcn.org> 	

	o Changed format of Changelog putting most recent entries up top.
	o Renamed CHANGES to ChangeLog.
	o Renamed TASKS to TODO.
	o Fixed bug in aflibAudioFile constuctor that caused segfault if
	  _file_return was NULL.
	o Fixed bug in aflibMemCache which caused position = -1 to be
	  cached.
	o Updated aflibAudioSampleRateCvt to handle -1 position.
	  Added isChannelsSupported function since class only handles
	  up to two channels.	
	o Fixed bug in aflibConvertor which caused too many samples
	  to be processed if the requested number of samples was more
	  then what was actually availible (i.e at the end of file).
	  The fix is a guess at how many samples to process and more
	  work will need to be done to make it more accurate.  
	o Fixed bug in aflibAudio which caused _cvt to receive the
	  wrong config if a _mix was also added internally.
	o Added virtual setPowerMeter and setAudioSpectrum functions to
	  aflibAudioSpectum class so one may inherit this class and do
	  what they want when these functions are called.  This will allow
	  more then one power meter and/or audio specturm per app.
	o In aflibAudio, getName() and compute_segment() no longer required
	  to be implemented.
	o Changed aflibSoxFile module to link to external libst.a library.
	o Added aflibDebug class to consolidate calls to stderr and getenv.
	o Added file conversion test scripts to osalp directory.
	o Cleaned up osalp example to better explain how to use the library.

------------------------------------------------------

05/20/2001     V 0.7.1 Beta released.

------------------------------------------------------

12/15/2000     Fixed passing of file name to external modules like lame, blade, 
		and mpg. Now accounts for blanks in file names.
12/25/2000     Changed prog directory to osalp and added README and 
		functionality for command line program.
01/02/2001     Fixed bug in aflibAudioEdit class with getSegment function. Also 		fixed some compile warnings in formatlib sub dirs.
01/03/2001     Made some code review changes.
02/21/2001     Made fix for freebsd. Changed atoll to sscanf.
03/12/2001     added support for passing format string to aflibAudioFile::open.

		BUG FIX: added aflibAudio::isChannelsSupported(int& channels).
		Some file modules would crash or write improper data if the 
		number of channels in the aflibData object sent was not
		supported.  Also added aflibAudio::convertChannels to do this.

		Cleaned up aflibData::convetToSize.  
		- use glibc byte swap it they have it.
		- moved bit shifting to macros.
		- got rid of a intermediries.
		- moved endian checks outside of conversion routines.

		BUG_FIX: fixed bug in aflibSampleData::process where
		aflib would crash if premature EOF

		Rewrote aflibFile::parseModuleFile() to query modules
		rather then using aflib_module.list file. 					

03/17/2001    Bug Fixes:
                1. Removed extra magic lines for wav and au. Only need to 
		recognize one.
                2. Change magic for mp3 from 1d3 to ID3.
                3. Changed format names from AU to AU-ALAW and AU-ULAW.
                4. Fixed audiofile lib for aiff format with tags on 0 length.

03/23/2001    Fixed cache problem in aflibAudio::process. When a node was at 
		the start of a chain and all data was retrieved from cache the 
		aflibConfig data was not being set in the aflibData object.
04/07/2001    1. Fix crash when a zero length copyright text field is in an 
		aiff format file.
              2. For au format if an unsupported compression file (ie G721) is 
		selected then library will crash sometimes. Problem is track 
		structure is not being initialized correctly.
              3. For au format for compression modes the total frames was coming
		back half of what it should be and thus only half of file was 
		being played.
              4. Fixed distortion for a-law and mu-law stereo files for both wav
		and au.
04/08/2001    1. Fixed write of alaw and ulaw. Data was scrambled and size was 
		wrong.
              2. Also audiofile library does not support 8U data for alaw and 
		ulaw so we now convert to 16S first for wav and au.
04/15/2001    Changed audiofile library to write WAVE ALAW and MULAW formats for 		
		WAVE instead of IBM. I believe the WAVE's are more popular.
04/21/2001    Fix mpg module. Corrected run-on problem with some mp3 files and 
		also fixed a crash with some other mp3 files.
04/22/2001    Added comments to many files for doxygen generation.
              Removed old files in formatlib/mp3/mpg and formatlib/linux_dev.
              Renamed files in mpg123 to Mpg123 to distinguish from Mpg for 
		doxygen.
              Since number of channels can be changed automatically I changed 
		aflibAudioEdit to accept inputs with different number of 
		channel inputs.
04/26/2001    Changed loading of modules from RTLD_NOW to RTLD_LAZY. This was 
		needed for Solaris since the mpg module had unresolved errors 
		for -lnsl.
04/29/2001    Added sox to Makefile.am for make dist option. Also added sox 
		include files.
              Fixed sox module for config data passed into open. This is not to 
		be used but returned. Was using junk data. Also fixed a-law and 
		u-law in sox module.
04/30/2001    Fix AIFC format with markers. Sox module does not allow markers 
		without instruments. My docs says markers can be used.
              Fixed sox module for AU format with A-LAW encoding. Added a break 
		statement to case statement. Submitted bug report to sox 
		maintainer.
              Fixed g721 decoding for AU format. Not 100% yet but better.
05/03/2001    Fixed recoginition of Amiga 8svx files in sox modules.
              Fixed Amiga 8svx files in sox source. They were not setting length
		field. I will submit a bug report to maintainer.
              Fixed close of aflibSoxFile.cc when an error occurs during open 
		for read. File would crash.
              Fixed initialization of eof flag. Not being set to 0.
              Fixed crash in Sound Blaster VOC format code fox sox module.
05/08/2001    Made some partial fixes to sox modules for WAVE a-law & u-law 
		write. Also VOC write and au G721 write.

------------------------------------------------------

12/03/2000     V 0.7 Beta released. Added support for Solaris Sparc platform. 
		Also fixed Makefile and install system.

------------------------------------------------------

11/15/2000     Changed entire makefile system. Now we can make and install 
		libraries.  Sample applications are made seperately.
 11/21/2000     Made initial Solaris on Sparc and Big Endian changes.
 11/29/2000     More Solaris changes. Fixed Solaris recording to device.

------------------------------------------------------

10/02/2000     V 0.6 Alpha released. Many bug fixes including improvements. 
		Added WAV AU file formats for a-law and mu-law. Also documents 
		are now in doc directory in html and man page format.

------------------------------------------------------

08/23/2000     Made many optimizations to the aflibMemCache class. Data was being
                copied and copied all over. Now just maintain a common pointer. Changed
                from STL set to map so that aflibMemNode data can be changed.
 08/24/2000     Moved mp3 play file support to a seperate file. It is now called
                aflibMpgFile. This was in both blade and lame files. Now blade and
                lame only write and mpg will read.
 08/25/2000     Changed name of aflibAudioClip to aflibEditClip. Now all aflibAudio derived
                objects start with aflibAudio as the file name.
 08/26/2000     Modified comments in library so I can use the doxygen tool (www.
                doxygen.org) to generate documentation.
 08/27/2000     Changed aflibDevFile to use different size buffers depending on size of
                data to be played or recorded. Setup a 0.2 second buffer for play and
                0.5 second buffer for record.
 08/28/2000     Made some changes to editor application to get it working again.
 09/03/2000     Made changes to auto recognition of file formats. Now an entry in the
                aflib_modules.list file can have more than one MAGIC line. This is since
                some formats, like mp3, can be recognized in multiple ways. Also two new
                flags can be entered in a MAGIC line. Instead of a position one can 
                enter a -1 or -2. A -1 causes a search of the file for the following
                items. The position in following items are relative to where the -1 item
                was found. A -2 ends the search mode. Also added with this new
                capability is another way to search for MP3. Some MP3's actually have a
                RIFF WAVE header followed by a data field where the MP3 starts. This can
                get confusing since RIFF WAVE is used by WAV format.
 09/07/2000     Fixed dumpChain routine so that it works again. Also fixed mixing in 
                example program prog. Fixed the passing of config data in aflibAudio base
                class when a node is disabled. Added aflibAudioStereoToMono class. It
                is derived from aflibAudioMixer class and is a convience class for mixing
                either a stereo or mono signal to a mono signal.
 09/08/2000     Added setItem & getItem as virtual function of the aflibFile base class.
                This can be used for getting and setting information that is specific
                to a particular file format.
                Added setItem to aflibDevFile class with an item of AFLIB_DEV_ITEM_BUFFER.
                This allows the setting of buffer lengths during record and playback.
 09/09/2000     Fixed mulaw au format write in audiofile library. Added alaw for au and
                wav formats and mulaw for wav format in audiofile library. Also now
                return error code for aflibMpgFile class when application mpg123 is
                not found. Also route stderr to /dev/null for all modules that call
                an external application.
 09/17/2000     Made more fixes to editor sample program and fixes to aflibAudio and
                aflibAudioEdit for multiple parent support.
 10/01/2000     Used electric fence memory debugging tool and fixed several memory
                errors with library.

------------------------------------------------------

08/21/2000     V 0.5 Alpha released. Bug fixes plus added audio mixing class,
                aflibAudioMixer. Also started command line example program: prog.

------------------------------------------------------

07/16/2000     Added LiteClue widget to player test program to provide bubble help.
 08/19/2000     Added aflibAudioMixer class. This allows mixing any number of inputs
                and combinations to an output with any number of channels. Also added
                ability in the aflibAudio base class to handle multiple parents of
                an object. Also added replaceParent in the aflibChain base class for
                derived classes to use.

------------------------------------------------------

07/09/2000     V 0.4 Alpha released. Bug fixes plus added automatic data conversion
                routines. Also added memory caching class.

------------------------------------------------------

03/19/2000     Found that audiofile library was returning a format of signed data for 8 bit
                WAV data. It should return unsigned format for 8 bit data. Fixed local
                audiofile library and submitted bug fix to author.
 05/01/2000     Added three new virtual functions to the aflibAudio base class that derived
                classes can override. They are isDataSizeSupported(), isEndianSupported(),
                and isSampleRateSupported(). These will be called by the base class. This
                allows derived classes to indicate what kind of data is supported. These
                three items will be automatically converted when needed.
                To the aflibAudio base class 4 new virtual functions have been added. They are
                setInputConfig(), getInputConfig(), setOutputConfig(), getOutputConfig().
                These allow one to set the input audio configuration and output audio
                configuration of each derived class. Thus a derived class can map the
                audio configuration data. For instance the sample rate converter class can
                change the sample rate in the output audio data configuration with
                respect to the input.
                Deleted the aflibAudioFileWrapper and all derived classes. Instead used a
                "C" function in each file object to allocate a file object. This removes the
                need to mangle a name for the wrapper object.
                Added logic to preprocess chain the first time data is processed to see
                if sample rate conversion is needed.
 06/04/2000     Changed the algorithm used in the aflibFFT class. The one I added I believe
                to be in the public domain. I removed the one that was there because it was
                GPL and not LPGL. Now that I have the public domain algorithm the library
                is LGPL. Also the aflibAudioSpectrum was modified for this new FFT algorithm.
 06/21/2000     Fixed memory bug (array overrun) in aflibEnvFile.cc.
 07/05/2000     Added memory caching class for derived classes that need it. It is not an
                optimal algorithm but it will do for now. Made aflibAudio derived from this
                class so that all derived objects pick this up. By default it is disabled since
                most classes will not use it. Changed aflibAudioSampleRateCvt class to use
                this class by default. Users can still go back to built in caching for this
                class by disabling caching in the base class. Also added aflibAudioPitch class.
                This simply overrides the aflibAudioSampleRateCvt class and implements a new
                setInputConfig function so that the output sample rate is the same as the input
                sample rate thus giving the illusion of pitch change.
 07/08/2000     Fixed process function in aflibAudioEdit class. Undated it with recent
                changes.

------------------------------------------------------

02/23/2000     V 0.3 Alpha released. Added plugable module file support. Added au, aiff
                aifc, and blade & lame encoder formats.

------------------------------------------------------

02/10/2000     Changed num_samples in process function of aflibAudio object to now be a
                reference. This way objects that only return a portion of the data requested
                can set the actual number. This is needed when reading from an audio file.
                The last block read might only be a partial block. Users calling process 
                should read num_samples after the call to determine the actual data
                processed.
 02/14/2000     Changed aflibFile so that audio file format derived objects are loaded
                dynamically and thus apps don't need to link to them. Also added AUTO type
                so audio files will be automattically recongnized. Currently available
                file formats are specified by an ASCII file called aflib_modules.list. The
                path to this file must be set as environment var AFLIB_MODULE_FILE_DIR.
                Also added several new audio file formats by using the audiofile library.
                Changed WAVE to use audiofile library, added aiff, aifc, and au. Also
                Created two mpeg audio objects. Both use mpg123 to read mp3 files. One
                uses the lame encoder and the other the blade encoder.
 02/19/2000     Made changes to player application to put description in upper left hand
                corner. Also added getFormat member function for aflibFile and
                aflibAudioFile. For auto format mode in aflibFile this will return the format
                of the file being played.
                After playing many aiff files and not having them play I did an investigation.
                It turns out that these files are not formatted according to the AIFF spec. They
                are adding an extra 8 bytes to the size field. This causes problems for the
                audiofile library. I submitted a suggested workaround to the author of the
                audiofile library.
 02/20/2000     Made changes to add three new values to each file format. They are value1,
                value2, and value3. These are used in order to select additional capabilities
                for a format. For instance to select output bit rates for mp3. Or a compression
                type for a format.

------------------------------------------------------

01/08/2000     V 0.2 Alpha released. Three new classes.

------------------------------------------------------

12/23/1999     Added new class aflibAudioConstantSrc.
 01/08/2000     Added new classes aflibConverter and aflibAudioSampleRateCvt. This provides
                convertion of sample rates from one to another. Also minor fix for
                aflibAudioConstantSrc. The incorrect mid point was being used.

------------------------------------------------------

12/22/1999     V 0.1.1 Alpha released. Mostly bug fixes.

------------------------------------------------------

11/05/1999     Made changes to aflibChain base class so that if audio object is removed
                from chain that all nodes are updated and chain reforms and is not
                broken.
                Added dumpChain function to aflibChain.
 11/07/1999     Fixed aflibAudioRecorder. Also modified player to perform audio timer
                recording correctly.
 11/08/1999     Performed work on editor to add functionality.
 11/13/1999     Removed addInput and removeInput from aflibAudioEdit. Instead get callbacks
                from aflibChain when addParent or removeParent are called.
 12/22/1999     Added lib directory. Changed last bstring to string. Updated mp3 file
                library to use latest mpg123.
